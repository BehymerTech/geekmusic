### Title: Port Song 2: Remote File and Command [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEENcM0sQps)

```
Remote file, and command 
These are the ports, to have in hand

You want remote, command line? 
No hash here, plain-text is fine
Quick and dirty? 
Yeah you bet
Port 23 connects Telnet

Remote command, now secure
Send your scripts, safer than before
Port 22,  with TCP
SSH, that's where I'll be

All these files, to upload
Files transferred, and controlled 
Just send to me with FTP 
With 21 and 20 TCP
You wanna send but not to check 

Send 'em my way
say what the heck
Just send to me TFTP 
Port 69 and UDP

Server Message Block, Windows Shares
(TCP) 137-139, if you care
NFS, Remote Files for Linux
TCP 2049 connects to this

These are the ports, Yeah I'm sure
I've studied them, Many times before 
Now I stand, with cert in hand
Follow me, you'll understand
```
