```
7 layers make up the OSI Model
So you don’t have to send that message in a bottle
Each layer adds it’s own encapsulation
They all work together for communication
 
First off, let's get physical
If you want to go digital
Binary signal, ones and zeroes
Put your bits on the wire and here we go
 
Second - think - Data - Link
Frame up data use your MAC to sync
Switches and bridges will be your friend
But beware as broadcast domains extend
 
Third is network and now it gets real
Your data now in packets has some network appeal
Routers join networks, break broadcast domains
IP addresses have entered the game
 
Fourth is transport it may start to get hazy
TCP works hard UDP is lazy
SYN SYN/ACK --ACK Handshake Hollaback 
TCP connects but UDP lost track

```
[Chorus - x2]
```
Five is how you keep your session alive
Open, close, and manage, all the data that’s inside
Tunnel those sessions to keep you connected
While my Flow control gives you the throughput you expected
 
Six comes in for user presentation
Encoded ASCII for a simple demonstration
Data once encrypted is encrypted no more
Jpeg mpeg and GIFs galore
 
You know the Top of the stack is the application layer
This is where all your data comes together
SSH, FTP, DNS and hypertext
All live at the top so you know it's the best
```

### Outro
```
That’s the OSI model and have no fear
Because we started at the bottom But now we’re here
Remember each layer and where it stands
And we know that you can pass that exam.
```

[Chorus - x2]
 
### Chorus
```
Bits, Frames, Packets, Segments, Data 
```
