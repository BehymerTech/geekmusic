```
DHCP, it gives to me 
An address auto-mat-i-cally
On 67 and 68
It sends its traffic over UDP

DNS, yeah itâ€™s the best
Ask the name and it gives the address
It will be on 53
Both TCP AND  UDP

That website, in all its bytes
It's ust plain text sitting in plain sight
HTTP loaded for me
Using TCP port on 80

Hypertext - yeah it's great 
Until you find you need to obfuscate
HTTP, security 
Hit me up on four fourty three 
(and you know I'm talking TCP)
